    <!-- Background Research  -->
    <div class="white-background">
        <h5 class="box">Background Research</h5>
        <p class="overview-info">
            Redesigning Jira is a challenging task due to its need to maintain consistency with the current branding and user experience. As a platform designed for a wide range of teams and industries, any redesign must remain flexible enough to cater to various use cases while improving usability. Our goal is to make Jira easier to use without compromising its adaptability for different teams.
        </p>
        <p class="overview-info"></p>
            To better understand the platform, we created a Jira account for our team and explored the interface. We found it difficult to navigate, particularly the onboarding process, which lacked clarity and actionable insights. To gain a deeper understanding, we watched YouTube tutorials, but even then, we realized that the platform could benefit from a more intuitive and user-friendly design.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- User Personas  -->
    <div class="personas gray-back">
        <h5 class="box">User Personas</h5>
        <p class="overview-info">
            We developed these personas through user interviews and research, focusing on the needs, goals, and challenges of our key users, such as a marketing assistant and a product manager. These personas helped us better understand how users interact with the platform and ensured our redesign addressed their specific pain points.
        </p>
        <p class="overview-info">
            Here is an example of one of our personas:

    <!-- competitive analysis   -->
    <div class="white-background">
        <h5 class="box">Competitive Analysis</h5>
        <p class="overview-info"></p>
            We analyzed tools like Trello, Asana, Monday.com, and Notion to inform our Jira redesign. For our project, we want to maintain the advanced project management features that Jira has, but use Notion’s clean user interface as inspiration to reduce confusion for users.
        </p>
        <div class="comp-img">
            <img src="images/jira-comp-analysis.png" alt="User Persona">

    </div>

    <!-- UX Flow  -->
    <div class="ux-flow gray-back">
        <h5 class="box">UX Flow</h5>
        <p class="objectives-info">
            Our research revealed that Jira’s onboarding process lacks essential information. Given that Jira serves a wide range of teams, removing features isn’t the solution—instead, we need to enhance the onboarding experience.  
        </p>
        <p class="objectives-info">
            <strong>How can we improve Jira’s onboarding to better accommodate different roles?</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="objectives-info">
            Our team developed two distinct UX flows for the onboarding process, each offering a unique approach to improving the experience. The two flows provide an onboarding process that helps junior team members become familiar with Jira and accustomed to completing complex functionalities.
        </p>
        <div class="comp-img">
            <img src="images/jira-uxflow-1.png" alt="Jira UX Flow">
        </div>
        <p class="objectives-info">
            <em>UX Flow 1</em> – A role-specific walkthrough that tailors the onboarding experience based on the user’s job function. This guided introduction highlights essential features relevant to their role, ensuring a more intuitive and efficient onboarding process.

        <div class="comp-img uxflow-2">
            <img src="images/jira-uxflow-2.png" alt="Jira UX Flow">
        </div>
        <p class="objectives-info">
            <em>UX Flow 2</em> - This approach retains Jira’s existing onboarding while integrating an AI chatbot. The chatbot serves as an on-demand assistant, allowing users to ask questions and receive guidance on Jira’s features, improving accessibility and reducing the learning curve.

    <!-- ui sketches  -->
    <div class=" white-background">
        <h5 class="box">UI Sketches</h5>
        <p class="objectives-info">
            During the sketching process, our team explored various layouts to enhance Jira’s onboarding experience, focusing on presenting key information, optimizing user flow, and improving understanding. Guided by our UX flow, we prioritized essential screens and analyzed competitors like Asana to identify effective onboarding elements. This helped us design a more customized experience tailored to different user roles.

    <div class="gray-back">
        <h5 class="box">Low Fidelity</h5>
        <p class="objectives-info">
            Since Jira serves diverse users, a one-size-fits-all approach isn’t effective. We refined our UX flow, brainstormed ideas, and created two low-fidelity prototypes based on competitor analysis and sketches.
        </p>
        <div class="comp-img">
            <img src="images/jira-lofi-1.png" alt="low-fidelity 1">
        </div>
        <p class="objectives-info">
            Prototype A maintains Jira’s login flow and builds on its role-selection feature with guided onboarding. Instead of overwhelming users, it highlights key tools through interactive walkthroughs and offers role-based templates to streamline setup. This approach enhances usability while preserving Jira’s flexibility.
        </p>
        <div class="comp-img">

            Prototype B improves onboarding with an AI chatbot that offers real-time guidance, answering questions and providing step-by-step support. A “Click to Learn” feature delivers quick explanations, while the AI adapts to user behavior with proactive tips, ensuring a seamless learning experience.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Low Fidelity User Test  -->
    <div class="style-guide white-background">
        <h5 class="box">Low Fidelity User Test</h5>
        <p class="objectives-info">
            We conducted user testing with a Product Manager from Western Digital and a Software Engineer from Hologic to evaluate the usability of Prototype A and Prototype B. 
        </p>
        <p class="objectives-info"></p>
            <b>Prototype A:</b> Participants found it clear and easy to navigate, with one noting that the video tutorial idea was helpful. However, one participant found some buttons unclear, and both agreed some parts felt unnecessary.
        </p>
        <p class="objectives-info"></p>
            <b>Prototype B:</b> One participant found it easier to navigate, while the other was confused by the page connections and unclear actions. This highlighted the need for better wireframing and clearer navigation.        
        </p>
        <p class="objectives-info"></p>
            <b>Preferences:</b> 
            Both participants preferred a combination of features from both prototypes. Participant #1 favored Prototype B for its integration of interactive walkthroughs and an AI assistant, while Participant #2 preferred Prototype A's interactive tasks but suggested adding the AI assistant from Prototype B for additional guidance.
        </p>
        <p class="objectives-info"></p>
            Overall, the user feedback emphasized the importance of combining interactive tasks with AI assistance to create a more effective onboarding experience.

    <!-- hi fi  -->
    <div class="gray-back">
        <h5 class="box">High Fidelity Prototypes</h5>
        <p class="objectives-info">
            For our high-fidelity prototype, we combined insights from user interviews and merged both versions of our UX flow. This prototype features both a customized onboarding process and an integrated AI chat for enhanced user support.

            Due to time constraints, we conducted informal user interviews to test our hi-fi prototype. Here’s what we found:
        </p>
        <p class="objectives-info"></p>
            Users appreciated elements from both prototypes. One participant liked the login page from Prototype 1 and the colors in Prototype 2, suggesting combining aspects like the highlighted words from Prototype 2 and the more straightforward roadmap screen from Prototype 1. Both participants recommended integrating the 'Chat with AI' feature into the final design. 
        </p>
        <p class="objectives-info"></p>
            The alternate version was seen as more seamless, especially with the template pop-up, while the original prototype’s guided walkthrough was appreciated for its structured onboarding. Participants suggested merging these strengths by combining the intuitive navigation of the alternate version with the guidance from the original. They also recommended making the AI chat feature less intrusive, proposing it as a smaller pop-up that users could expand.

            This class is shaped by the effort you and your group put into it. It can be easy to feel like you don’t need to try too hard since assignments aren’t graded harshly, but the quality of your case study will reflect the work you put in. The more effort you invest, the better your final project will turn out. Looking back, I wish I had put in more effort, but the project we chose left me feeling stuck, especially because Jira’s complexity has a purpose, which at times made it hard to stay motivated. Finding a platform to redesign can be challenging, especially when it needs to be something used by industry professionals. Many platforms are already well-designed with large teams of developers and designers behind them. My advice is not to get overwhelmed—take your time and focus on making the most of the process.
