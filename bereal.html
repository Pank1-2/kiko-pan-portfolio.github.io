    <!-- project overview section  -->

        <h5 class="box">Overview</h5>
        <p class="overview-info"> 
            This app extension project was made for an upper-division design class at UC San Diego called Social Computing. In this class, we explored the intersection 
            between social behavior and computational systems. For the final project, we designed a social computing experience that can be functional and "played/utilized" 
            by multiple people within a specific setting.
        </p>
        <p class="overview-info">The main motivation behind this project was to create a novel app that brings communities of people together to create long lasting memories. 
        </p>

    <!-- objectives  -->
    <div class="objectives gray-back">
        <h5 class="box">Objectives</h5>
        <h6 class="objectives-heading">Brainstorm</h6>
        <p class="objectives-info">
          We wanted to come up with an idea that incorporates dance and social interactions. Motivated by the concept of BeReal, we decided to build off of the app and create an extension. 
          Currently, when a BeReal notification goes off, users take a photo of what they are currently doing and post it onto the app for friends to view. We wanted to incorporate a similar idea but with dance instead. 
        </p>
        <h6 class="objectives-heading">Background Research</h6>
        <p class="objectives-info">
          Based on our research of the current platform, we saw many BeReal users express their opinions on community threads. One user mentioned that the platform “limits the socializing part, making it impossible to obsess over and spend countless hours” on the platform. Not only that, an article discussing the decline of BeReal mentioned problems in authenticity. The decline in authenticity stems from our concerns about what others think of us, discouraging us from posting. </p>
        <p class="objectives-info">
          The usage of the app has been slowly declining because it gets repetitive when we take snapshots of the same activity every day, whether it’s doing homework on our desks, walking to/from campus, running errands, etc. 
        </p>
        <p class="objectives-info">
          This is where BeReal Jam steps in. It addresses these issues by bringing users back onto BeReal by incorporating different dances and songs every day to prevent repetitiveness, encouraging people to post.
        </p>
        <h6 class="objectives-heading">Researh Objectives</h6>
        <p class="objectives-info">
          We came up with a few research objectives we wanted to address in our project:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Explore the role of dance in fostering connections and community engagement among friends.</li>
          <li>Analyze user attitudes towards dance as a form of expression within social media contexts.</li>
          <li>Assess how often people dance and how much they enjoy dancing.</li>
          <li>Analyze the strengths and limitations of competitor apps.</li>
        </ul> 
        <h6 class="objectives-heading">Design Goal</h6>
        <p class="objectives-info">
          Based on our research, many BeReal users feel that BeReal is a great platform to capture spontaneous moments in their lives daily. However, they lose interest due to the repetitive nature of the experience. In order to foster relationships and facilitate new social connections on BeReal, our team will be designing an extension to BeReal that allows users to create dance content with friends, anywhere at any given time.

        <ul>
          <li>How do people engage with others through BeReal?</li>
          <li>How much time do people spend on BeReal?</li>
          <li>How connected do people feel when they interact with their friends on BeReal?</li>
        </ul> 
        <p class="survey-info">
          To gather immediate feedback, we used convenience sampling and gathered data from 23 participants through classes, friends, and work. We distributed an online Google Form survey through Discord, Instagram, and Messages.

        <p class="survey-info">
          The survey includes 11 questions, both open-ended and quantitative, in order to gain an understanding of what challenges or problems our users are facing with BeReals current app.

                Just Dance is an interactive dance video game where users follow dance moves and score points in competition with their friends. While it's a popular game, the use of sensors to monitor movements can pose drawbacks, especially with more players joining. Users need to stand at a certain distance for the sensors to capture their movements, but this distance is often unclear until they begin playing, leading to potential frustration. The presence of animated avatars in Just Dance can detract from the authenticity of the experience. We want to prioritize authenticity among users, encouraging genuine expression and interaction through spontaneous dance challenges and community engagement features.

                Snapchat Spotlight is a feature offered on Snapchat for creating short videos including dance challenges, skits, and creative storytelling. However, it lacks interaction due to the absence of a commenting feature that limits engagement. The anonymity of creators can also hinder the formation of new relationships. We want to explore ways in how we can feature original content while also fostering new connections by allowing users to add strangers to their dance mashup videos, promoting social interaction and community building.

        As part of the project, we had to create a playable in-person prototype. Given the short time frame for the project, we are not expected to fully execute the app idea on BeReal.

        <p class="usertestOne-info">
        We started off the prototyping session by introducing our app extension idea and showing users a little bit of how it works. We first showed the audience a tutorial of our group dance when it was edited together. This was made to give users a feel of the viewer experience since we can’t edit their videos together during the short prototyping session. We also had a Slido pulled up on the screen for the audience to comment as we played the video to create a more interative and immersive experience.

          After the 5 minutes, we recorded the dance giving them two tries, one practice round, and one official round. Then we showed them their dance video with a Slido chat, facilitating a comment feature to enhance user interaction and provide a richer, more immersive experience within the app.

        <h5 class="box">User Testing - 2</h5>
        <p class="testing-info">
          We started off the second prototype with a recap of BeReal Jam and clearly stated what happens when you miss the initial Jam. If you miss the first notification which includes a 3 hour time frame to record your video, you can still post late, however, you lose out on voting. You will 
          see your friend's dances as usual and your friends will get a notification that their video has been editied. 
          <p></p>
          We added an additional voting feature allowing users to vote for the song they will be dancing to in the next Jam. Voting takes place after users record their video. 
          <p></p>
          Also, we added various difficulty levels to account for beginner dancers and more advanced dancers. We included 3 levels: Easy, Normal, and Hard. 
          <p></p>
          Last but not least, we added a new feature called BeReal Challenges. You can challenge your friends or strangers to a one-on-one dance battle where your friends can vote for the better dancer. You will be dancing to the Jam song of the day and you can either follow the moves or create your own dance. 
          <p></p>
          Before having users test out the new features, we showed our audience what the jammer experience would essentially look like with user flows.

        <p class="testing-info">
          Instead of having users take part in a regular Jam as we did in the first prototype, we decided to have them test out BeReal Challenges.  
        </p>
        <h6 class="objectives-heading">Instructions for Prototype</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>Break into 4 groups with an assigned leader.</li>
          <li>Watch tutorial.</li>
          <li>Learn & Practice (2 min).</li>
          <li>Dance Battle (2 volunteers per group).</li>
          <li>Watch Battle + Vote!</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="testing-info">
          After two minutes, we had 2 people from each group come to the front and take part in a dance battle. Instead of having users learn the whole dance, we made them learn parts of the dance so one member from groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 was on a team and the other remaining 4 members were a team. 
          <p></p>
          To do the challenge, we had group member 1 dance their part then members 2, 3, and 4 will follow after. 
          <p></p>
          The rest of the class was the audience and they watched both teams side by side. We also had a slido for comments as they watched the teams dance live.

        We also had users vote for the next jam song. Usually, the Jam voting does not take place after a challenge, it takes place after you record your Jam but we decided to let the audience vote to give them a feel of the new voting feature.

      <ul>
        <li>Users found the prototype easy to understand and the dance tutorial easy to follow.</li>
        <li>Users enjoyed the dancing experience.</li>
        <li>Users liked the difficulty level (easy, normal, hard) options for the dance.</li>
        <li>Users enjoyed the concept of the dance battle.</li>
        <li>Users thought it was hard to watch both teams side by side.</li>

      <h6 class="objectives-heading">Design System</h6>
      <p class="final-design-info">
        For our design system, we have introduced a new logo for BeReal Jam that seamlessly integrates with the existing color palette, ensuring coherence across the current BeReal interface. Our efforts have extended to the augmentation of the BeReal UI with novel components such as slider bars and buttons, enriching the user experience while maintaining the distinct identity of our design.

      <h5 class="box">Next Steps</h5>
      <p class=" final-design-info">
        After gathering feedback from our second prototyping session, we brainstormed some changes we can incorporate in the future: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A play speed option for dancing tutorials (can slow down or speed up the tutorial for personal needs)</li>
        <li>A verbal command along with dancing tutorials to further facilitate the learning experience</li>
        <li>A dual screen feature where users can dance along the tutorials while they record themselves on the phone’s selfie camera</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="final-design-info">
        We received a lot of positive feedback as well as desires to make our prototype into an actual feature in BeReal. Thus, for our next steps, we would polish our prototype and design features to match seamlessly with the BeReal app. Then, we will start the testing phase by having users test our fleshed out features on the BeReal app. Eventually, we will have BeReal Jam become a part of BeReal’s regular function.
